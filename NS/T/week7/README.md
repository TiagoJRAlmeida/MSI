# Summary

- Focus on **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** and **Distributed DoS (DDoS)** attacks as threats to service availability.
- Main attack vectors:
    - **Flooding attacks** (ICMP, UDP, TCP)
    - **SYN spoofing**
    - **Reflection and amplification** (Smurf, Echo-Chargen, DNS, NTP, SSDP)
    - **HTTP-based attacks** (HTTP Flood, Slowloris)
- Use of **botnets** to coordinate large-scale attacks.
- Emergence of DDoS-as-a-Service as a criminal business model.
- Statistical insights (e.g., Kaspersky reports): attacks are longer, more frequent, and more sophisticated.
- Mitigation strategies:
    - **Traffic filtering and anti-spoofing**
    - **Limiting exposed services**
    - **Blackhole routing** (with potential side effects)
    - **ISP-level cooperation**
