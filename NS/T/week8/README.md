This class extends the study of **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attacks, focusing on countermeasures and firewall-based defences:

- **DoS mitigation strategies**: prevention, detection, source traceback, and reaction.
- **Technical measures**: ingress filtering, rate control, SYN cookies, and coordinated incident response.
- **Firewalls:**
  - **Packet filtering** (based on headers and ports),
  - **Stateful inspection** (maintaining connection state),
  - **Application proxies** (deep inspection and policy enforcement).
- **Firewall policy models**: permissive vs. restrictive.
- **Rule configuration and ordering**: common pitfalls and best practices.
